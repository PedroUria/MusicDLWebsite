  <h1>Classical 846 LSTM</h1>
  <h2>What is this?</h2>
    <p>This is a webpage hosting some LSTM networks we trained to generate music. LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) is a type of neural network that can learn temporal patterns. Thus, when trained on musical data belonging to an author, it is able to learn their style and generate new music.</p>
    <p>I decided to develop this website because I was learning HTML, CSS and Django, and needed a fun project to do while doing so.</p>
  <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>Easy! Click in one of the supported authors to access the network trained on this particular composer. Then, just choose a note or a sequence of notes as input, and see what comes out!</p>
    <p>Some sample auto-generated tracks are also provided to let you have an idea of what might be generated.</p>
