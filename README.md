# MusicDLWebsite

Website to generate music using trained LSTM Networks. Hosted at [www.lstmmusic.com](http://www.lstmmusic.com/). First website, excuse me for the messy code.

Built with Django (Python 3.7.6). This will work on a local machine by running `python manage.py runserver`, but needs some changes for deployment (see deployment_existing.txt).
